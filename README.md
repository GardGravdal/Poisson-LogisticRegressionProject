# Poisson-LogisticRegressionProject
This is a project in the NTNU-course TMA4315 - Generalized Linear Models. This project is in two parts. Part 1 covers logistical regression for a categorical regression problem on the response failed/successfull ascension with height and prominence as covariates. Part 2 covers a model of the norwegian top fotball division 'Eliteserien'. We attempt to model the strength of the teams in Eliteserien, as well as predicting the final league table at the end of the season based on the remaining games. This project was made in collaboration with Marcus Hj√∏rund (see https://github.com/marcushjorund).
